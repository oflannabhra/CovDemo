We also add abs_path which is like __FILE__ but __FILE__ can be fooled
by a sneaky "chdir" while abs_path can't. 

If you are running on Ruby 1.9.2, require_relative is the pre-defined
version.  The benefit we provide in this situation by this package is
the ability to write the same require_relative sequence in Rubinius
1.8 and Ruby 1.9.
